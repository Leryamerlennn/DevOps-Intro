## Task 1 — SSH commit signing

### Benefits of signing commits
- Authenticity: proves who created the commit.
- Integrity: helps detect tampering with commit history.
- Trust in collaboration: reviewers can rely on verified authorship.

### Why is commit signing important in DevOps workflows?
Commit signing increases supply-chain security and accountability: teams can verify that code changes come from trusted identities, which reduces risk of malicious or spoofed commits.
